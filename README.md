# LM_Python_AsyncIo_Billiard

==>Project's Purpose:
The purpose of this project is to create a Python utility that uses AsyncIO and Billiard to detect misspelled keywords. Given a keyword, the utility will fetch Google suggestions, analyze them, and determine if the provided keyword is misspelled. If it's misspelled, the utility will provide suggestions for the correct keyword, along with additional information.

==>Setting Up and Using the Utility:
1.Clone the Git repository containing the utility.
2.Install the required dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file using a package
3.Ensure that you have Python 3.7 or later installed.
4.Run the utility from the command line with one or more keywords as arguments
5.The utility will asynchronously fetch Google suggestions for each keyword, analyze them based on the provided criteria, and display the results in JSON format

==>Problem Statement or Context:
The problem statement is to create a Python program that detects misspelled keywords and suggests possible correct keywords. The program uses Google suggestions obtained through the Google suggestion API. The criteria for misspelled keywords include the keyword being absent from Google suggestions, having a length less than or equal to 2, or having fewer words than the shortest Google suggestion. If the keyword meets any of these criteria, it is considered misspelled, and the correct keyword is suggested as the shortest suggestion from Google.

==>Additional Information:

    The utility uses AsyncIO for asynchronous operations to fetch Google suggestions efficiently.

    Billiard is employed to parallelize the processing of multiple keywords concurrently.

    The utility ensures code quality and adherence to PEP 8 standards by using Flake8 for linting. A pre-commit hook can be set up to automatically check code quality before          committing changes.

    Comprehensive test cases are included in the project to validate the functionality of the utility. These test cases should cover various scenarios and edge cases to ensure the reliability of the program.

    The solution is expected to be submitted via a Git repository. The repository should contain a proper README file providing instructions on how to use the utility, set up the environment, and any other relevant information for users or contributors.

    A .gitignore file is provided to exclude unnecessary files or directories from being pushed into the Git repository, ensuring that only essential project files are version-controlled
